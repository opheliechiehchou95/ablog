# Thoughts on the tracking of deep consequences of leaders

![My helpful screenshot](https://opheliechiehchou95.github.io/ablog/assets/2023-12-19-my-thoughts-1.png)


## Introduction 

Like the acting of politicians for the country,
the acting of IT leaders have **deep consequences** for the **organization**. Especially long-term consequences.

I believe those long-term consequences MUST be stronger evaluated, 
to judge about the career of IT leaders.

For example 
- by establishing a suitable evaluation-framework for HR, reaching far beyond the final reference-lette, often created by the partner in crime - the direct boss. 

- by research on the web.


## Example 

Lets take Mr. **Dirk Muthig** as example.

### "Fraunhofer" institute - 8 years

After writing many papers at "Fraunhofer" institute in Kaiserslautern, 
with zero hands-on experience 
Dirk Muthig moves into the industry.

```
Profile:
Dirk is a a professional generator of academic papers.
Dirk professionally writes papers about "distributed platforms".

Dirk never participated in software development cycle, 
never demonstrated any ability to create sofware.

```

### "Lufthansa Systems" - 3 years +1 in Budapest

At Lufhansa Systems he spent **3 years** doing something some "distributed platform",
and gets moved to Budapest as "CTO", where he spends 1 year and leaves.

Smells like the famous relocation to Greenland

```
Profile:
Dirk was building something, what never got used and was promoted away to Budapest, where he was not able to perform and left.

```


### "Siemens" - 6 years

Dirk Muthig relocates to Siemens, to build a **platform for IoT enabled buildings**.

Here Dirk show himself as an absolute sociopathic person.


#### Not able to communicate.

Dirk Muthig is not able to communicate with the business colleagues, ignores any wish or advice of sales.

As the result he **doesnt learn anything about the smart-building domain** .
And in a mindless way continues to build a "distributed platform", ignoring business, requirements of business units.

He only can do so, because his hiring managers come from the manufacturing, never did software, just blindly support him.


```
Profile:
Dirk Muthig destroys any contract to business units, by his misbehaviour. So the platform he builds now - is not suitable for business needs of Business Units.

Dirk Muthig destroys any contract to colleagues.
He is a micro-manager, without any ability to listen of delegate.
He is yelling at people, to cancel any feedback.
He is mobbing anyone, who is questioning the suitability of Dirks "distributed platform" for business. 

By being a dictator in an ivory tower - he now is totally isolated and builds his dogmatic, isolated "distributed platform"

His manager still blindly supports.

```


#### Reality confrontation.

After spending millions on building his "distributed platform" top management finally gets aware, that after 5 years and millions invested - there is zero revenue.

- The top-management cuts the budget.
- The top-management wants to see some revenue.
- Dirk finally must sell something

```
Profile:

Top management FORCES the business units to use the platform, 
but they dont want to work with Dirk Muthig.

Dirk Muthig continuously ignored their needs and the platform is not suitable for business.

In addition the mobbed employees start a compliance process against Dirk. 
Mobbing. Bossing. Harassment. These are the accusations.

Dirk is finally confronted with the reality of business requirements.

Dirk immediately leaves.
```


### "Porsche" - ? years

Now Dirk Muthig is hired again, to build a new "distributed system".


I think this image should be here.

Next "Distributed platform" approaching.


## Pointe

The long-term impact of Dirks work is catastrophic.

- Dirk Muthig's inability to communicate.
- Dirk Muthig's missing expirience with practical technology

lets him build "distributed platforms", which do not hold business requirements.

- Dirk Muthig's sociopathic mind doesnt let him learn from colleagues

That means Dirk builds throw-away "distributed platforms" spending millions.


I really hope, that someone from HR.

Especially Porsche HR.

That HR starts analysing the impact of the long-term impact of IT leaders work.
